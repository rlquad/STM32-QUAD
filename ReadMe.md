### CODE IS RUNNING AT 64MHz AND ANGLE CALCULATION CODE FOR SIMPLE COMPLIMENTARY FILTER TAKES ABOUT 500us

### MOTOR CONTROL IS CARRIED OUT EVERY 4000us BY MAKING USE OF TIMER INTERRUPT. IT IS INDEPENDENT OF THE ANGLE 
    CALCULATION CODE TIMING. SO GREATER FREEDOM CAN BE EXERCISED FOR ENABLING BETTER CODE FOR ANGLE CALCULATION AND PID
    WITHOUT THE FEAR OF INTERFERENCE WITH MOTOR CONTROL CODE.
    
### RECEIVER PWM MEASUREMENT IS CARRIED OUT THROUGH 5 INDEPENDENT TIMER CHANNELS. USE OF EXTERNAL INTERRUPTS FOR THE
    SAME DID NOT YIELD EXCEPTED RESULTS.
